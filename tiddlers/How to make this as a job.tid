title: How to make this as a job
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* I need to find time for writing during the day. This can be 30 minutes during the day or 1 hour later.
* Every week Sunday I should have an article that is ready to be published. 
* This should give me the whole week to use to both research and write about the topic.
* Keep a list of topics that I want to write about.
