Engineering managers play a crucial role in leading and guiding teams of engineers to achieve their goals. While the specific responsibilities of an engineering manager may vary depending on the industry, company, or project, there are several key areas in which they ought to excel.

First and foremost, engineering managers must be skilled in people management. They need to be able to build and maintain strong relationships with team members, provide mentorship and guidance, and foster a culture of collaboration and open communication. According to an article by Harvard Business Review, "the best engineering managers are those who can empower their teams to deliver their best work."

In addition to people management, engineering managers must also excel in organizational management. They must be able to coordinate and prioritize tasks and projects, allocate resources effectively, and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. This requires a high level of organizational and strategic thinking, as well as a keen eye for detail and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.

Finally, engineering managers must possess strong engineering abilities. While they may not be the ones writing code or designing products, they must have a solid understanding of the technical aspects of their projects in order to effectively manage their teams. As an article in TechRepublic notes, "the ideal engineering manager is one who understands the technical nuances of the job, and is capable of getting into the weeds when necessary."

In conclusion, effective engineering management requires a combination of strong people management skills, organizational management abilities, and a deep understanding of the technical aspects of the work being done. By excelling in these areas, engineering managers can lead their teams to success and drive innovation and progress in their industries
